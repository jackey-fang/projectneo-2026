# Project NEO

## Project description
Near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) are routinely monitored by multiple space agencies for potential future impacts with Earth. Two of the most widely used systems are:
- NASA Sentry (Jet Propulsion Laboratory, USA)
- ESA Aegis (European Space Agency)
Both systems independently compute impact probabilities (IP) for potentially hazardous asteroids using different orbit determination pipelines, dynamical models, and observational datasets. Although the overall conclusions are usually consistent, numerical impact probabilities and risk assessments may differ.

In this project, data published by NASA and ESA will be collect, cross-match, and statistically compare asteroid impact probability.
